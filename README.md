# 9to5News Scraper
### Scrapes RSS Feeds of 9toGoogle and 9to5Mac and displays titles and links to recent articles.

All news articles link back to the appropriate site. Script only scrapes and does not modify data in any way.
This is just a nice, easy way to see the most recent news pieces, with a direct link to the article for further reading.
#### This is for practice with Python web scraping. No infringement or theft is intended!
